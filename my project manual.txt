launch 3 instances(ansible, web, db)in one time by giving no of instance count in the public subnet with keys enable all traffic enabled
note: subnet is associated and internet gateway is added to the route in all the 3 instances
select the ansible instance and connect as ec2-user and rest the 2 instances
go to instance named ansible and install ansible package
now type sudo su
amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y and press enter it will install ansible packages 
now i need to change host name
cd /etc/hosts host
it is a file and not a directory
nano /etc/hosts and enter
and go to web instance and copy the pvt ip and go to db instance and copy the pvt ip as below
pvtip web
pvtip db
ctrl+x and yes enter
ping web and press enter
you will get a reply from web instance
ping db 
you will get a reply from db instance and to escape press ctrl+c
cd /etc/ansible/
i can find 3 files like ansible.cfg , hosts and roles(directory)
nano hosts and enter and add the below lines on the top 
web ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user ansible_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/key
db ansible_ssh_user=ec2-user ansible_private_key_file=/etc/ansible/key and press ctrl+x and yes and press enter
now iam going to create a key inside ansible directory
to check the present working directory enter pwd command 
output:/etc/ansible
Now will create a key 
nano key selected for that instance under keyname and press enter and go to keypair pem and copy the content and paste inside the file which is opened
press ctrl+x and press enter or ctrl+ enter ctrl+x
ls-la in this users and groups and other users is having the permission so we need to reduce the permission so type the below commands
chmod 600 key and enter
now try to connect 2 instances like web and db by the below commands
ansible web -m ping and enter you will get a green color code having success at the top
similarly ansible db -m ping and press enter you will get a green color code having success at the top
and lets try for all the instances like web and db by typing the command below
ansible all -m ping
now you will get the two success msgs from both instance let's say web and db
nano playbook.yml and press enter go to github playbook3.yml  and copy the code and paste below and ctrl+x and yes and enter

following this to explain the code inside the playbook.yml file
go to the location of key1 and enter into the cmd mode and type ssh -i key1.pem ec2-user@publicip of ansible instance and press y and enter
sudo su
nano /etc/ansible/playbook.yml and press enter
you will get a code so that we can explain about the code 

continuation after the 38th line:
==================
now i will execute the playbook.yml file so type the command as below
ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/playbook.yml and press enter
first it is installing all the gathered parts
first it will install httpd install 
next it will install php
next it will install php-mysql
next it will install git
then start webserver completed
clone repository 
gathering part for db
installing mariabdb
mariadbserver
git
start mariadb
added db
added table
restarted web 
gathering changes in the webserver
restarted the web
after executing all the tasks in yml file you will get and output below:
db     :ok=8 (nothing but how many tasks are completed)  changed=7 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0
web    :ok=7 (nothing but how many tasks are completed)  changed=5 unreachable=0 failed=0 skipped=0 rescued=0 ignored=0

now successfully completed  page

now go to webserver public ip and paste in a browser and you can able to view the content inside

i can execute the yum file again and again and is idempotent i.e is not overwritten.




for suppose:
in web instance: 
cd /etc/www/html
ls and press enter the following files will be displayed as below:
assets(dir) css9(dir) fonts(dir) img(dir) index.php js(dir) README.md scss(dir) vendors(dir)
rm -rf .git .gitignore and enter it will not uninstall bcx u don't have sudo priveliges
in db instance:
cd /ashiq/
ls enter following below files will be displayed
assets/ css/ fonts/ .git/ /img js/ scss/ vendors/
rm -rf * .git .gitignore and enter it will not uninstall bcx u don't have sudo priveliges
then place sudo before rm -rf * .git .gitignore
 
even if i remove anything from web and db instance and if you run the yml file again  yum file will install all the things 
which are deleted.
